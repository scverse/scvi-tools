# Tutorials

The easiest way to get familiar with scvi-tools is to follow along with our tutorials.
Many are also designed to work seamlessly in Google Colab, a free cloud computing platform.
Tutorials by default work with the latest installable version of scvi-tools. To view older tutorials,
change the documentation version using the tab at the bottom of the left sidebar.
