abstract = {Summary
Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a powerful and increasingly popular technique to explore the regulatory landscape of heterogeneous cellular populations. However, the high noise levels, degree of sparsity, and scale of the generated data make its analysis challenging. Here, we present PeakVI, a probabilistic framework that leverages deep neural networks to analyze scATAC-seq data. PeakVI fits an informative latent space that preserves biological heterogeneity while correcting batch effects and accounting for technical effects, such as library size and region-specific biases. In addition, PeakVI provides a technique for identifying differential accessibility at a single-region resolution, which can be used for cell-type annotation as well as identification of key cis-regulatory elements. We use public datasets to demonstrate that PeakVI is scalable, stable, robust to low-quality data, and outperforms current analysis methods on a range of critical analysis tasks. PeakVI is publicly available and implemented in the scvi-tools framework.}

  abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},
