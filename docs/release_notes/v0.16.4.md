# New in 0.16.4 (2022-06-14)

Note: When applying any model using the {class}`~scvi.train.AdversarialTrainingPlan` (e.g. {class}`~scvi.model.TOTALVI`, {class}`~scvi.model.MULTIVI`), you should make sure to use v0.16.4 instead of v0.16.3 or v0.16.2. This release fixes a critical bug in the training plan.

## Bug Fixes
- Fix critical issue in {class}`~scvi.train.AdversarialTrainingPlan` where `kl_weight` was overwritten to 0 at each step ([#1566]). Users should avoid using v0.16.2 and v0.16.3 which both include this bug.
