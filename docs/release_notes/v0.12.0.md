# New in 0.12.0 (2021-07-15)

This release adds features for tighter integration with Pyro for model development, fixes for {class}`~scvi.external.SOLO`, and other enhancements. Users of {class}`~scvi.external.SOLO` are strongly encouraged to upgrade as previous bugs will affect performance.

## Enchancements

- Add {class}`scvi.model.base.PyroSampleMixin` for easier posterior sampling with Pyro ([#1059]).
- Add {class}`scvi.model.base.PyroSviTrainMixin` for automated training of Pyro models ([#1059]).
- Ability to pass kwargs to {class}`~scvi.module.Classifier` when using {class}`~scvi.external.SOLO` ([#1078]).
- Ability to get doublet predictions for simulated doublets in {class}`~scvi.external.SOLO` ([#1076]).
- Add "comparison" column to differential expression results ([#1074]).
- Clarify {class}`~scvi.external.CellAssign` size factor usage. See class docstring.

## Changes

- Update minimum Python version to `3.7.2` ([#1082]).
- Slight interface changes to {class}`~scvi.train.PyroTrainingPlan`. `"elbo_train"` and `"elbo_test"` are now the average over minibatches as ELBO should be on scale of full data and `optim_kwargs` can be set on initialization of training plan ([#1059], [#1101]).
- Use pandas read pickle function for pbmc dataset metadata loading ([#1099]).
- Adds `n_samples_overall` parameter to functions for denoised expression/accesibility/etc. This is used in during differential expression ([#1090]).
- Ignore configure optimizers warning when training Pyro-based models ([#1064]).

## Bug fixes

- Fix scale of library size for simulated doublets and expression in {class}`~scvi.external.SOLO` when using observed library size to train original {class}`~scvi.model.SCVI` model ([#1078], [#1085]). Currently, library sizes in this case are not appropriately put on the log scale.
- Fix issue where anndata setup with a layer led to errors in {class}`~scvi.external.SOLO` ([#1098]).
- Fix `adata` parameter of {func}`scvi.external.SOLO.from_scvi_model`, which previously did nothing ([#1078]).
- Fix default `max_epochs` of {class}`~scvi.model.SCANVI` when initializing using pre-trained model of {class}`~scvi.model.SCVI` ([#1079]).
- Fix bug in `predict()` function of {class}`~scvi.model.SCANVI`, which only occurred for soft predictions ([#1100]).
