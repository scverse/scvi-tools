# New in 0.14.2 (2021-10-18)

Bug fix and new tutorial.

## Changes

- Bug fix in {class}`~scvi.external.RNAStereoscope` where loss was computed with mean for a minibatch instead of sum. This ensures reproducibility with the original implementation ([#1228]).
- New Cell2location contributed tutorial ([#1232]).
