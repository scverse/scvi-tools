# New in 0.14.4 (2021-11-16)

Bug fixes, some tutorial improvements.

## Changes

- `kl_weight` handling for Pyro-based models ([#1242]).
- Allow override of missing protein inference in {class}`~scvi.model.TOTALVI` ([#1251]). This allows to treat all 0s in a particular batch for one protein as biologically valid.
- Fix load documentation (e.g., {meth}`~scvi.model.SCVI.load`, {meth}`~scvi.model.TOTALVI.load`) ([#1253]).
- Fix model history on load with Pyro-based models ([#1255]).
- Model construction tutorial uses new static setup anndata ([#1257]).
- Add codebase overview figure to docs ([#1231]).
